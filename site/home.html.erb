            <h1>Get Here</h1>
            <p>Getting to the North Pole is a tricky business. Not everyone makes it, but we recommend flying because it is more expensive than any other option and makes us the most money. Besides, it melts the caps so we won't have to work for much longer. Santa isn't as kind as one might think... Anyways, it's a win-win! You get here, and we don't have to work.</p>

            <h1>Where To Go</h1>
            <p>On the North Pole, there really isn't very much to do. The only place you <i>really</i> can go is (not surprisingly) the North Pole. It isn't even that great. Antartica is better to be honest. Still lights, is actually a continent and the polar bears are swapped for penguins. Just go visit the South Pole instead you dummy!</p>

            <h1>See & Do</h1>
            <p>Unless you live at a latitude less than 65 degrees Latitude, nothing is new. Really. For those of you whose winter don't claim the lives of your loved ones: Welcome! Everything on the North Pole revolves around snow. It's really hard for it not to.</p>

            <h1>Eat & Drink</h1>
            <p>You can't eat anything besides seal fat because nothing grows here. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. To accompany it, you can have melted ice. It's quite sad.</p>
